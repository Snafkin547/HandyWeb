### The website consists of three features: 
 - Spam Email Detection (NLP related project)
 - Summary Creation (Also NLP project
 - Tax Calc (This is just an optional trivial project) 

Therefore, I experimentarily created this platform, learned how-to, and actually made my projects accessible by whoever has the <a href="https://mywebsite-snafkin.herokuapp.com/">link</a>.

I used Flask to manage/link python codes with HTML.
