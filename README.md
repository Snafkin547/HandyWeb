# MyWebsite

This is my first web platform, in which currently only a few functions are available.

 - Spam Email Detection (NLP related project)
 - Summary Creation (Also NLP project
 - Tax Calc (This is just an optional trivial project) 

Though this is not any form of functional web-app, I created this to bring my projet up to deployment.
I have done several Data Science/AI related projects but they have never been to make production phase. Meaning, nobody, but me, can actually use my projects.
Therefore, I experimentarily created this platform, learned how-to, and actually made my projects accessible to anyone who has the <a href="https://mywebsite-snafkin.herokuapp.com/">link</a>.

At least that was the the idea behind why I created this.

I used Flask to manage/link python codes with HTTP.
